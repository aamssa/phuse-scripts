; Folder structure
We need to establish a folder structure so that we can organize the files in a meaningful way. 
Here is what I am proposing:


./trunk/{type}/{lang}/{cat}/{prg|sub-cat}/

where 
  {type}     - folder type: docs|lang|etc
  {lang}     - language folder: SAS|R|plsql|SPSS|JAVA|C|perl|etc
  {cat}      - script category: report|graph|released|...
  {prg}      - program name or sub-category; for large program with multiple source files, it can have the following sub-folders:
    ./baks   - backups of milestone versions
    ./released - final milestones
    ./builds - testing for packing the scripts
    ./data   - sample or testing data
    ./docs   - stores the documents for the requirements, proposed solutions, etc. 
    ./src    - stores the source programs and scripts
    ./result - expected output result 
    ./qual   - qualification process and steps

Here is an example of the folder structure:
trunk
  ./docs - documnets for describing a procedure, report, program or anything related to the repository.
  ./lang - languages such as SAS, R, PL/SQL, etc
      ./SAS
      ./R
      ./plsql
      ./SPSS
      ./JAVA
      ./C
      ./perl
      ./etc
  ./etc



; Name convention of a script or program file:

Proposal: {prg|sub-cat}[_{term}].{ext}
  where
    {prg|sub-cat} - program name or sub-cat such as PK
    [_{term}]     - (optional) meaningful term
    {ext}         - language extension such as sas, sql, java, R, etc.
  For instance: PK_dual_box.sas, PK_dual_box.R

For metadata file: {prg|sub-cat}[_{term}]_{ext}.yml  
For instance: 
  Program : PK_dual_box.sas, PK_dual_box.R
  Metafile: PK_dual_box_sas.yml, PK_dual_box_R.yml
