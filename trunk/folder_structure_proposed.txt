We need to establish a folder structure so that we can organize the files in a meaningful way. Here is what I am proposing:


./trunk/{type}/{lang}/{cat}/{prg|sub-cat}/

where 
  {type}     - docs|lang|etc
  {lang}     - SAS|R|plsql|SPSS|JAVA|C|perl|etc
  {cat}      - report|graph|...
  {prg}      - program name; for large program with multiple source files, it can have the following sub-folders:
    ./baks   - backups of milestone versions
    ./data   - testing data
    ./docs   - stores the documents for the requirements, proposed solutions, etc. 
    ./src    - stores the source programs
    ./result - expected output result 
    ./valid  - validation process and steps

trunk
  ./docs - documnets for describing a procedure, report, program or anything related to the repository.
  ./lang - languages such as SAS, R, PL/SQL, etc
      ./SAS
      ./R
      ./plsql
      ./SPSS
      ./JAVA
      ./C
      ./perl
      ./etc
  ./etc
